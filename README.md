**Book Recommendation System**

**Description**

The Book Recommendation System is an intelligent application that provides personalized book recommendations based on user-book ratings using singular value decomposition (SVD). Users can interact with the system through an intuitive interface powered by Streamlit and explore recommendations, visualizations, and feedback options.

**Key Features:**

Book Recommendations: Users can input a book ID and receive personalized recommendations for similar books.

Data Visualizations: Interactive visualizations, including a user-book matrix heatmap and rating 
distributions, offer insights into the dataset.

SVD-powered Recommendations: The system uses SVD to generate recommendations based on the similarity between user-book interactions.
